Java Terminal Banking System

This project is a terminal-based banking app that allows users to:
- Create accounts
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Transfer funds
- View transaction history
- Calculate compound interest using recursion

The project uses 3 data structures:
1. ArrayList to store all accounts
2. HashMap to map account IDs to accounts 
3. LinkedList to store each account's transaction history

Three main algorithms used:
1. Transfer funds: Checks accounts, verifies balance, updates both accounts, and logs transactions
2. Recursive interest calculator: Uses recursion to calculate future value over time
3. Transaction history viewer: Loops through a LinkedList and prints each transaction

This app was built in Java and runs in the terminal.
